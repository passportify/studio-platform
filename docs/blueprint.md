# **App Name**: Passportify Lite

## Core Features:

- Data Model Visualizer: User-friendly interface to view the 23 interconnected functional blocks and their relationships in the core data model.
- Simplified Data Input: Simplified data input forms for single-tier supplier data aligned with key DPP requirements (ESPR, Battery Regulation).
- Compliance Check: AI-powered "tool" to validate entered data against regulatory requirements and flag potential compliance issues.
- DPP Generation: Generates a basic, standards-compliant DPP based on the inputted data.
- Secure DPP Sharing: Enables secure sharing of generated DPPs.
- Access control: Implements role-based access control for viewing/editing DPP data.
- Industry Information: Captures the primary industry and sub-industry of the company. Governs applicable DPP schemas and validations.
- Product Category: Standardized taxonomy linking to EU-recognized registries (eCl@ss, CN, TARIC, UNSPSC). Enables delegated act mapping.
- Product Metadata: Core technical and commercial data fields (GTIN, SKU, battery type, product name, specs, etc.). Anchors DPP identity.
- Product Variants: Captures multiple product configurations (e.g., color, size, capacity). Enables versioning at the variant level.
- Product Images & Files: Media, manuals, datasheets, SDS, labeling assets. Serves both compliance and consumer transparency purposes.
- Product Lifecycle Events: Logs dynamic data: maintenance, usage, EoL, return, recycling. Useful for circular economy and warranty updates.
- Company Information: Profile of the manufacturer/importer. Holds org-level IDs, VAT, roles, CSRD relevance, etc.
- Facility/Location Data: Tracks all physical locations (factories, recycling sites, warehouses) with geolocation and facility IDs.
- Supplier Master: Links Tier 1–n suppliers, onboarding status, approvals, contact metadata.
- Material Composition: BOM/Bill of Materials breakdown, part IDs, substances (including SVHC), origin, and recycled content flags.
- Certificates & Declarations: EU DoCs, REACH, RoHS, CE, CB, third-party attestations. Required for compliance and trust.
- QR/DPP Code Engine: Generates resolvable GS1 Digital Links or DID/VC-based QR codes. Anchors the DPP to the physical product.
- Public DPP Viewer: Front-end page or app to display DPP data to public users or regulators.
- Change Log & Versioning: Immutable version history of product passports and material declarations.
- Audit Trail & Log Viewer: Tracks who updated what and when. Optionally anchored on blockchain for tamper-proof logs.
- Multilingual Support: Enables DPP content translation into 24+ EU/local languages for legal and consumer display.
- Country Pack Compliance Engine: Handles local regulations (e.g., France's repair index, EPR per region) on top of EU laws.
- Blockchain Anchoring: Anchors data hashes (e.g., certificates, events, sign-offs) on a public or permissioned ledger.
- Digital Signature Engine: Adds cryptographic or legal electronic signatures (eIDAS-compliant) to DPPs, supplier attestations.
- Multi-Tier Supplier Traceability: Resolves upstream supplier chains (Tier 2–n) with recursive BOM mapping and data invitations.
- AI-based Document Intelligence: Extracts structured data from unstructured uploads (PDFs, emails, Excel, Word). Feeds Block 10, 11, etc.
- Human-in-the-Loop AI Review: Review interface for validating extracted fields before submission. Adds manual confirmation layer.
- Integration Hub (ERP, ECHA, GS1): Enables data exchange with SAP/Oracle, ECHA SCIP, GS1 resolvers, and APIs for customs/IoT/cloud sync.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A strong blue (#2962FF), to suggest stability and regulatory compliance.
- Background color: A very light blue (#E5E9FF), visibly the same hue as the primary color, but heavily desaturated and bright.
- Accent color: A violet (#A329FF) to contrast the primary, and call attention to special UI elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, to highlight its technical, modern purpose.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for readability.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to represent data elements and functionalities.
- Prioritize clear data presentation with well-defined sections and logical flow.
- Subtle transitions to highlight changes or status updates, enhancing the user experience.
